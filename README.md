🧪 Data Generation

The synthetic dataset simulates monthly sales data incorporating trend, seasonality, and noise components. The data spans from January 2018 to December 2023.

Components:

    Trend: Linear increase from 100 to 500 over the period.

    Seasonality: Sinusoidal pattern to mimic seasonal effects.

    Noise: Random noise added for realism.

The generated data is saved as synthetic_sales_data.xlsx.
💻 Installation

    Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/timeline-forecasting.git
cd timeline-forecasting

Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

Install the required packages:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

    Note: If you plan to use Facebook Prophet, ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed as per Prophet's installation instructions.

🚀 Usage

    Generate synthetic data:

python generate_data.py

This will create synthetic_sales_data.xlsx in the project directory.

Run ARIMA forecasting:

python arima_forecasting.py

This script reads the synthetic data, fits an ARIMA model, forecasts the next 12 months, and plots the results.

Optional: Run forecasting with Facebook Prophet:

    python prophet_forecasting.py

    Ensure that Prophet is installed and properly configured.

📊 Results

The ARIMA model forecasts are visualized alongside the actual synthetic data, providing insights into the model's performance. The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is calculated to evaluate forecast accuracy.

Sample Output:
